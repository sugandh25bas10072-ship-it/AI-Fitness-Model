# AI Fitness & Health Calculator

Overview
The AI Fitness & Health Calculator is a Python-based interactive console project that helps users evaluate their health profile using BMI, daily calorie requirements, and personalized fitness advice. It applies basic computational logic, conditional structures, modular programming, and user input processing.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of Python functions, workflow design, validation, and algorithmic decision-making.

Features
- BMI Calculation (Body Mass Index)
- BMI Category Classification
- Daily Calorie Needs Calculation (using Mifflin-St Jeor Equation)
- Personalized Fitness Recommendations
- Activity Level Based Calorie Adjustment
- Modular & Clean Function-Based Design

Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Standard Library (no external dependencies)

How to Run
1. Install Python 3.8+  
2. Run the script:
python main.py
3. Enter user details as prompted.

Testing Instructions
- Test with different BMI ranges (underweight, healthy, overweight, obese)
- Validate calorie outputs with online calorie calculators
- Test gender variations
- Test each activity level (1–5)
